# neural_networks_with_numpy
you'll become familiar with the fundamental concepts and terminology used in deep learning, and understand why deep learning techniques are so powerful today. You'll build simple neural networks yourself and generate predictions with them.Here, you'll learn how to optimize the predictions generated by your neural networks. You'll do this using a method called backward propagation, which is one of the most important techniques in deep learning.
